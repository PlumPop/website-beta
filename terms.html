                <p>
                    Other than for your payment obligations, neither party shall be liable for any delay or
                    nonperformance due to acts of God, natural casualties, war, terrorism, material shortages,
                    transportation and communications delays, energy shortages and disruptions, trade embargoes,
                    governmental regulations, strikes, civil unrest and/or other causes beyond the reasonable control of
                    a party (a “Force Majeure Event”). If a Force Majeure Event occurs, the party whose performance is
                    affected shall give the other party written notice within ten (10) days of such occurrence,
                    detailing the circumstances of the Force Majeure Event and an estimate of the anticipated delay in
                    performance. The party whose performance is affected will use commercially reasonable efforts to
                    develop a mutually acceptable work around plan in an attempt to minimize the impact of the Force
                    Majeure Event. Performance shall be promptly resumed upon termination of the Force Majeure Event.
