                        withdraw your consent.

                    If you are visiting our Service from outside the United States, please be aware that your

                    If your Personal Data is subject to GDPR, in the course of providing the Service to you, we may
                    transfer your Personal Data outside of the EU, principally to our servers in the United States; this
                    means that your Personal Data will not have the automatic protection of European data protection
                    laws (including the GDPR) which apply in the EU. In these circumstances, in order to ensure that
                    your Personal Data continues to have adequate protection when it is transferred outside the EU, your
                    Personal Data will only be transferred on one of the following bases:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Where the transfer is subject to one or more of the appropriate safeguards for international
                        transfers prescribed by applicable law (for example, standard data protection clauses adopted by
                        the European Commission);
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A European Commission decision provides that the country or territory to which the transfer is
                        made ensures an adequate level of protection; or
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There exists another situation where the transfer is permitted under applicable law (for
                        example, where we have your explicit consent).
                    </li>

                    We will retain your Personal Data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this

                    The security of your data is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the
                    Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. We take precautions to insure that our
                    visitors’ Personal Data is secured and we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect
                    your Personal Data, but we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We use a variety of industry-standard technical, contractual, administrative and physical security
                    measures and procedures to help protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use, alteration
                    or disclosure. Unless otherwise provided, we restrict access to Personal Data to those employees who
                    need access to perform their job functions. Please note that despite our best efforts, no one can
                    guarantee the security of Personal Data. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure,
                    and other factors may compromise the security of Personal Data at any time.
